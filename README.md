What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The code that was given to me included the Game Experience and the Treasure Maze files and I was given the Treasure Hunt Game code as well but it was not fully complete. The Treasure Hunt Game file included the setup with the imports, the maze array, and it had multiple set ups as well. The main portion that needed to be completed is the deep Q learning portion which involved creating the epoch sequence as well as calling multiple different functions that give the epoch choices and other functions as well. It also goes through a loop to determine its current state and make sure that the game is not over. After that the episode is recored based on the previous state, action, reward, enviroment state, and game status. Then the nueral netwrok model is trained and the loss is evaluated. Then based on if the win rate is above a threshold and the model passes the completion check then that epoch is the correct. Then the system prints that winning epoch.
